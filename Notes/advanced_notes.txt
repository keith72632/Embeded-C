Thread Mode and Handler mode

What is thread mode?


Reset Handlers:
  -processor always starts in thread mode
  -generate interrupt by setting certain bits at IRQ register

What is handler mode?
  -handler mode is the mode that exception(interrupts) are handled in

How Do Thread Mode and Handler mode work together?
  Short answer is they have their own code region, RAM region and stack.

How to debug wether function is in thread or handler mode
  IPSR (Interrupt Program Status Register) has a bit field called ISR_NUMBER[8:0]
    -0=thread mode
    -1=reserved
    -2=NMI
    -3=Hard Fault
    -4=mem manage and so on
TDLR switching between thread and handler mode by triggering system exception, with handler mode always being privleged.

Access Levels of Prcessor
  a)Privileged
  b)Non-Privilege
  -Self explanitory, Certain registers are only accessed with full privilege PAL
  -By default, runs in PAL
  -In thread mode, once you move out of PAL, you cannot come back unless enter into handler mode
  -Handler mode is always PAL
  -CONTROL register is used to switch bewteen levels
