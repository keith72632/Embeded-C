Toggle Output Pin:
Refernce Manual:
	-memory and bus architecture->memory map
	-find base address and range. Ex. GPIOD 0x4002 0C00 - 0x4002 0FFF
	-all periheral registers in STM32 are 32 bits wide
	-different peripherals hhave different number of register
	-peripherals gave different mode registers. reference picture for GIOD register modes
	-for standard output pin, mode register and output data register are key
	-each peripheral register(line output) is 32 bits(4 bytes). register is 4 integers wide. 0x4002_0C00 through 0x4002_0C03
	-controlling output state:
		-1 high, 0 low
Procdure to turn on LED:
	-identify port used to connect led(GPIOD for onboard)
	-identify pin where light is connected(12 for onboard)
	-activate clock:
		-peripherals are dead until clock is enabled
		-find clock control registers RCC, Reset and Clock Control
			-in manual as reset clock control (RCC_AHB1ENR)
			-use Data Sheet to see which buses connect where
		-find base address (in memory map) (in this case is 0x40023800
		-add offset (in this case 0x30)
			-which equals 0x40023830
		-set bit for corresponding GPIO (GPIOD is 3rd). found under RCC AHB1 periph clock register in Ref man
	-configure GPIO pin as output
		-get base address of gpio mode register (GPIOD is 0x40020C00) and add offset (0x00)
		-*(page 281) there 16 pins, in each peripheral register that are two bits. to set mode of pin:
			-00 input
			-01 general purpaose output
			-10 alt function
			-11 analog mode
		-pin 0 has bits 0 and 1, in pin 1 has bits 2 and 3, pin 13 has 26 and 27 ect.
	-write to GPIO pin (1 high, 2 low)
		-find GPIOD register address
		-add offset (0x14 for GPIOD)
		-only 16 bits are available
		-toggle bit 0 - 15 for pins 0 - 15
			-labeled ODR(pinNum)
	
Notes:

	rcc base address: 0x40023800
	offset          : 0x30
	starting address: 0x40023830*
	bit for GPIOD clock : 3

	GPIOD mode reg base addr: 0x40020C00* (offset is 0x00)
	pin 12 (bit 24 and 25) set to 01

	GPIOD output data register addr = 0x40020C00
	offset                          = 0x14
	final addr                      = 0x40020C14*
	pin to toggle                   = 12

	
GPIOA pin 7 output:
        rcc base address: 0x40023800
        offset          : 0x30
        starting address: 0x40023830*
	bit 0

	mode reg addr: 0x40020000*
	bit 14 and 15 to 01

	gpioa output data reg add 0x40020000
	offset: 0x14
	regist addr: *0x40020014
	bit 7
